# OnyxLib
Ranchonyx's big bag of random useful (and not so useful) stuff I'm creating in my free time.

The first semi-stable OnyxLib version brings you:

FileWorker: get a string array from a plaintext file, each line represents one element; write a string array to a plaintext file the same way.

Gmail: Send mails using smtp via smtpauth login; comes with a ConfigWorker for storing user configs and loading them, and with a Contact class for storing recipient data.

ImageProcessing: Alter RGB channels of a given Image; Also comes with an OpenCV module for bodily feature detection, the haar cascades are seperately uploaded into this branch.

ObjectSerializer & ObjectDeserializer; For serializing objects and deserializing them.

RandomChars: Generate random alphabetical characters, or supply characters from you own array.

Sorters: WIP, contains a single insertion sort algorithm.

SoundWorker: Play an audio file, also contains WIP data.

SpecializedInformation: Contains methods for getting the current Runtime's free memory, total memory and available processors, furthermore contains a method for starting processes and byte-based memory definitions.
